# binwalk2

There is no binwalk2 there is only [binwalk][01]. Authors of binwalk got the
hype of Rust Lang and rewrite this tool in RUST. If you install latest binwalk
you won't be able to get the python bindings which formadyne wants! That is
why I have repackaged this tool with an older version. I have made small
renaming to avoid conflict. After installing my package you can also install
the latest binwalk.
